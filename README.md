RailwayOrientedProgramming
==========================

This is a version of the talk [Railway Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) by
[Scott Wlaschin](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/about/).
While the original language of the talk is [F#](https://fsharp.org), this version has been translated to JavaScript, because
the concept can be easily applied to JavaScript programming as well and the metaphor used is phenomenal.

Useful libraries for attempts in this direction are
1. [daggy](https://github.com/fantasyland/daggy) for [sum types](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/sum-types)
2. [ramda](https://ramdajs.com) for [composition](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#compose)

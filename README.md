RailwayOrientedProgramming
==========================

This is a version of the talk [Railway Oriented Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) by
[Scott Wlaschin](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/about/).
While the original language of the talk is [F#](https://fsharp.org), this version has been translated to TypeScript, because
the concept can be easily applied to TypeScript programming as well, and the metaphor used is phenomenal.

A useful library for attempts in this direction is
[fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) for the [result type](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts.html)
and for [composition](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/function.ts.html#flow)
